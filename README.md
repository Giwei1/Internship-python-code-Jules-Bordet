Code used to compare medical data and measurement on the Elekta unity using the Zeus MRgRT Phantom during an internship of 4 weaks in Jules Bordet in radiophysics
# MRI‚ÄìPhantom Motion Analysis

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts developed to analyze, process, and compare MRI and phantom motion data used in irradiation and latency experiments.  
All scripts were written by **Gilles Weinhofer**, **except for** `01_readaudit.py` and `02_latency.py`, with the latter being **slightly modified** to include the `gating.csv` file functionality.

## üìÇ Files Overview

### `01_readaudit.py`
Original external file ‚Äî not modified.  
Used as a reference in early stages of the project.

---

### `02_latency.py`
This file calculates the **beam latency** during irradiation.  
It uses the document shared by *Motion Control* after testing, named **`gating.csv`**, which contains all irradiation details.  

‚û°Ô∏è **How to use:**  
Insert your `gating.csv` file at **line 21** (where the CSV file is read) to visualize the latency data.  
A graph will then display all irradiation timing and latency information.

---

### `03_regularisation_audit.py`
This script processes the **`auditlog.csv`** file provided by the MRI system after measurements.  
It applies a series of necessary modifications and saves a new version of the file to avoid repeating the same preprocessing steps later.

‚û°Ô∏è **How to use:**
1. Provide your raw `auditlog.csv` file.  
2. Choose a name for the new processed copy ‚Äî recommended: **`auditlogModified.csv`**.

‚û°Ô∏è **Main features:**
- Splits the *vectorPosition* column into **X, Y, Z** components.  
- Splits the *predictedPosition* column the same way.  
- Computes the **vector magnitude**.  
- Corrects **Z offset** (removes unnecessary nonzero baseline).  
- Calculates **measurement time** starting from 0 s.  
- Adds **smoothed position columns** to reduce noise.

---

### `04_adaptation_MotionControl.py`
This script takes the **modified auditlog file** (from `03_regularisation_audit.py`) and creates new files readable by the **Motion Control phantom simulator**.

‚û°Ô∏è **Outputs:**
1. A **normal output file**: interpolated positions with constant time steps.  
2. A **limited output file** (optional): constrained by the physical limitations of the phantom.

‚û°Ô∏è **How to use:**
- Set `limit=True` or `limit=False` in the `Motioncontrol()` function to generate the desired version.  
- Choose output file names for both versions.

‚û°Ô∏è **Adjustable parameters:**
- **Threshold**: controls how aggressively sharp Z peaks are cut (default: `max = threshold √ó mean peak value`).  
- **Max norm**: default = 20 ; can be changed.  
  - Changing this modifies the X/Y/Z ratio (Z remains unchanged).

---

### `05_comparatif.py`
Primarily a **testing script**, not essential for the final workflow.  
It compares the **raw auditlog** with the **modified auditlog**, to visualize how the processed data differ from the original patient data.

‚û°Ô∏è **Potential improvement:**  
Currently, the script only handles one auditlog file.  
It can be generalized to compare **two different auditlog files** (e.g., patient vs phantom measurements).

---

### `06_MRI_phantom_comparing.py`
The **main analysis script** and the most comprehensive one.  
It compares MRI and phantom motion data to assess the **accuracy, latency, precision, and reliability** of both systems.

‚û°Ô∏è **Inputs:**
1. The file used as **input to the phantom** for the test.  
2. The **modified auditlog** from the MRI **after phantom measurements**.

‚û°Ô∏è **Modes (set in the main function):**
1. **Mode 1:** Manual shifting ‚Äî user chooses the time shift to align both signals.  
2. **Mode 2:** Automatic alignment ‚Äî detects the end of phantom motion and aligns accordingly.  
3. **Mode 3:** No shifting applied.

After alignment, an optimization function fine-tunes the signal alignment by minimizing the error between both signals.  
You can define the search range (in seconds) for this time shift ‚Äî estimated visually by plotting the two signals.

‚û°Ô∏è **Notes:**
- The script includes functions to compute multiple error metrics and compare all relevant parameters.
- The **`factor`** parameter refers to the multiplication factor applied in *Motion Control*.

---

### `07_Fictive_Signal.py`
This file generates a **synthetic (fictive) motion signal** from scratch.  
It is mostly used as a **reference or testing file** and should not be modified much.

‚û°Ô∏è **How to use:**  
Simply define the desired **output CSV file name** at the end of the script.  
Can be adapted to generate other fictive signals with different characteristics.

---

### `08_IrradiationPlot.py`
An **extra visualization file**, generating **graphs and statistical plots** that display prediction errors (e.g., boxplots).

‚û°Ô∏è **Input:**  
The **modified auditlog** file obtained after phantom measurement.

---

### `09_correlationPositionLatency.py`
An **unfinished exploratory script**, kept intentionally for future researchers.  
It investigates potential **correlations** such as:
- Prediction error vs latency  
- Prediction error vs irradiation on/off  
- And other possible relationships.

---

### `testplot.py`
A simple visualization script that displays **both signals before modification**, useful for quick visual checks.

---

## üß† Notes
- The focus of this repository is **motion tracking validation** between MRI and phantom systems.  
- Graphs and performance indicators are detailed in the internship report accompanying this project.  
- Some thresholds and parameters (e.g., limits, smoothing constants, shifting range) can be manually tuned depending on the dataset.
